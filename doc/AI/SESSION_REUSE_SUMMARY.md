# Summary: Session Reuse Architecture

## The Problem We Solved

Integration tests showed 7 "Unclosed connection" warnings during Test 7, even after converting all HTTP code to use `async with aiohttp.ClientSession()` context managers.

**Root cause**: Creating a **new ClientSession for every HTTP request** meant:
- 7 different sessions during Test 7 (which makes multiple HTTP calls)
- Each session has its own connection pool
- Each pool needs asynchronous cleanup time
- Program exits before all cleanup completes
- Python's garbage collector emits warnings

## The Solution

### Architecture Change: Shared Session Pattern

Instead of creating a session per request, we now support **session reuse**:

```python
# OLD (one session per request)
async def _get_device_info(self):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        response = await session.post(url, json=payload)
        # Session created and destroyed every time

# NEW (reuse session across requests)
async def _get_device_info(self):
    session = await self._get_session()  # Reuses existing session
    response = await session.post(url, json=payload)
    # Session lives for multiple requests
```

### Implementation

**1. VegeHub Constructor** - Optional session parameter:
```python
hub = VegeHub(ip_address="...", session=shared_session)
```

**2. Session Management** - Automatic creation if needed:
```python
async def _get_session(self):
    if self._session is None:
        self._session = aiohttp.ClientSession()
        self._owns_session = True
    return self._session
```

**3. Cleanup** - Close only if we created it:
```python
async def close(self):
    if self._owns_session and self._session:
        await self._session.close()
```

**4. Integration Test** - Share one session:
```python
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
    hub = VegeHub(ip_address=ip, session=session)
    # All tests reuse this single session
```

## Results

### Before
```
Unclosed connection (×7 warnings)
```

### After
```
============================================================
TEST SUMMARY
============================================================
Total tests: 8
  ✅ Passed:  8
  ❌ Failed:  0
============================================================
🎉 All tests passed!
```

**Zero warnings. Perfect cleanup. Problem solved!**

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Connection pooling works across requests (HTTP keep-alive)
2. **Clean exit**: Single session cleanup via `async with` context manager
3. **No warnings**: Guaranteed cleanup before program termination
4. **Backward compatible**: Session parameter is optional
5. **Test-friendly**: Easy to mock and clean up in tests

## Files Changed

- ✅ `vegehub/vegehub.py` - Added session support, updated all 7 HTTP methods
- ✅ `integration_test.py` - Uses shared session pattern
- ✅ `tests/test_vegehub.py` - Updated fixture with cleanup
- ✅ All 70 unit tests pass
- ✅ Integration test runs cleanly with no warnings

## Best Practices Applied

Following aiohttp documentation:

> "Don't create a session per request. Most likely you need a session per application which performs all requests altogether."

This is now the recommended pattern for:
- Integration tests
- Home Assistant integrations
- Any long-running application using the library

## Next Steps

For users of the library:
1. Pass a shared session when creating VegeHub instances
2. Call `await hub.close()` if no session was provided
3. Use `async with` patterns for clean resource management
