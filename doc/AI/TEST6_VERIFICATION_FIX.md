# Test 6 Actuator Control Fix

## Problem

Test 6 was passing even when actuator state verification failed. The test output showed:

```
Step 2: Verifying actuator state...
⚠ Actuator 0 state: 0 (expected 1)
...
✅ Actuator control: Command sent, verified, and cleaned up (4 actuator(s))
```

The test should have **failed** because the actuator didn't turn on as expected, but it passed anyway.

## Root Causes

### Issue 1: Missing `test_passed = False`

When verification failed, the code set `test_message` but forgot to set `test_passed = False`:

```python
# BEFORE (bug)
if actuator_0_state == 1:
    print("     ✓ Actuator 0 state verified: ON")
else:
    print(f"     ⚠ Actuator 0 state: {actuator_0_state} (expected 1)")
    test_message = f"State verification: expected 1, got {actuator_0_state}"
    # MISSING: test_passed = False
```

Since `test_passed` started as `True` and was never set to `False`, the test passed.

### Issue 2: duration=0 Not Suitable for Verification

The test was using `duration=0`, which might mean:
- The actuator turns on and immediately off
- Some devices might not respond to `duration=0` correctly
- By the time we check (0.5s later), the actuator has already turned back off

This meant we couldn't reliably verify the command worked.

### Issue 3: Missing Failure for State Retrieval

If state retrieval failed entirely, no error was recorded:

```python
# BEFORE (bug)
else:
    print("     ⚠ Could not retrieve states for verification")
    # MISSING: test_passed = False
```

## The Fixes

### Fix 1: Set test_passed = False on Verification Failure

```python
if actuator_0_state == 1:
    print("     ✓ Actuator 0 state verified: ON")
else:
    print(f"     ⚠ Actuator 0 state: {actuator_0_state} (expected 1)")
    test_message = f"State verification: expected 1, got {actuator_0_state}"
    test_passed = False  # ← ADDED
```

### Fix 2: Set test_passed = False if States Not Retrieved

```python
else:
    print("     ⚠ Could not retrieve states for verification")
    test_message = "Could not retrieve states for verification"  # ← ADDED
    test_passed = False  # ← ADDED
```

### Fix 3: Use duration=5 for Verification

```python
# BEFORE
success = await hub.set_actuator(state=1,
                                 slot=0,
                                 duration=0,  # Too short
                                 retries=2)

# AFTER
success = await hub.set_actuator(state=1,
                                 slot=0,
                                 duration=5,  # 5 second duration for testing
                                 retries=2)
```

### Fix 4: Increase Verification Delay

```python
# BEFORE
await asyncio.sleep(0.5)  # Might not be enough

# AFTER
await asyncio.sleep(1.0)  # Longer delay to ensure device has updated
```

## Why duration=5?

- **Long enough**: Gives us time to verify the actuator is ON (check at 1 second)
- **Short enough**: Won't cause issues during testing
- **Still safe**: The final cleanup step turns all actuators OFF anyway

## Test Flow Now

1. **Step 0**: Turn all actuators OFF (clean start)
2. **Step 1**: Turn actuator 0 ON with 5-second duration
3. **Wait 1 second** (actuator should still be ON)
4. **Step 2**: Verify actuator 0 is ON
   - ✅ If ON: continue
   - ❌ If OFF or can't check: **FAIL THE TEST**
5. **Step 3**: Turn all actuators OFF (cleanup)

## Expected Results

### If Actuator Works Correctly
```
Step 1: Turning on actuator 0...
✓ Command sent successfully
Step 2: Verifying actuator state...
✓ Actuator 0 state verified: ON
Step 3: Turning all actuators OFF...
✓ All 4 actuator(s) turned OFF

✅ Actuator control: Command sent, verified, and cleaned up (4 actuator(s))
```

### If Actuator Doesn't Turn On
```
Step 1: Turning on actuator 0...
✓ Command sent successfully
Step 2: Verifying actuator state...
⚠ Actuator 0 state: 0 (expected 1)
Step 3: Turning all actuators OFF...
✓ All 4 actuator(s) turned OFF

❌ Actuator control: State verification: expected 1, got 0
```

### If State Retrieval Fails
```
Step 1: Turning on actuator 0...
✓ Command sent successfully
Step 2: Verifying actuator state...
⚠ Could not retrieve states for verification
Step 3: Turning all actuators OFF...
✓ All 4 actuator(s) turned OFF

❌ Actuator control: Could not retrieve states for verification
```

## Impact

This fix ensures Test 6 properly validates that actuator commands actually work, not just that they can be sent. This is exactly what integration tests should do - verify real-world behavior.
