# Integration Test Cleanup Delay

## Problem

Even after converting all HTTP client code to use `async with aiohttp.ClientSession()`, the "Unclosed connection" warnings still appeared when running the integration test.

The warnings appeared specifically during Test 7, which involves multiple HTTP requests (get config, modify, set config, get config again, verify).

## Root Cause

The issue is **timing-related**:

1. The integration test completes
2. `asyncio.run(main())` begins shutting down
3. The event loop starts cleanup
4. Python's garbage collector runs
5. **Some aiohttp connections are still in the process of closing**
6. Warnings are emitted about "unclosed connections"

This happens because `asyncio.run()` exits immediately after the main coroutine finishes, not giving aiohttp's internal connection pooling time to fully clean up.

## The Fix

Added a small delay (250ms) at the end of the `main()` function before exiting:

```python
# Run tests
results = await run_integration_tests(selected['ip'], test_actuators,
                                      test_setup, restore_config)

# Print summary
results.print_summary()

# Small delay to allow aiohttp to fully close all connections
# This prevents "Unclosed connection" warnings from appearing
await asyncio.sleep(0.25)

# Exit with appropriate code
sys.exit(0 if results.failed == 0 else 1)
```

## Why This Works

The 250ms delay gives:
1. **Time for connection cleanup**: aiohttp's internal connection pooling to finish closing connections
2. **Event loop processing**: The asyncio event loop to process all pending callbacks
3. **Graceful shutdown**: All resources to be properly released before program exit

This is a common pattern when using aiohttp in scripts that exit immediately after making requests.

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### 1. Using ConnectorOwner
```python
connector = aiohttp.TCPConnector(limit=100)
async with aiohttp.ClientSession(connector=connector) as session:
    ...
await connector.close()
```
**Rejected**: Would require passing a connector to all functions, making the API more complex.

### 2. Disabling Connection Pooling
```python
connector = aiohttp.TCPConnector(limit=0)
```
**Rejected**: Worse performance, doesn't solve the underlying timing issue.

### 3. Longer Delays
**Considered**: Could use 500ms or 1s, but 250ms is sufficient and barely noticeable to users.

## Trade-offs

### Pros
- ✅ Simple solution (one line of code)
- ✅ No changes to library code
- ✅ No performance impact during tests (delay only at end)
- ✅ Reliable across different system loads

### Cons
- ⚠️ Adds 250ms to total test execution time
- ⚠️ Doesn't fix the root cause (asyncio/aiohttp timing)

### Why This is Acceptable

The 250ms delay is imperceptible to users running integration tests, which already take several seconds. The warnings are cosmetic and don't indicate actual resource leaks (the connections **are** being closed, just not fast enough for Python's garbage collector).

## Technical Details

### When Warnings Appear

The warnings occur when:
1. Multiple HTTP requests happen in quick succession (Test 7 does 3-4 requests)
2. The program exits immediately after the last request
3. aiohttp's connection pool hasn't finished cleanup

### Why async with Wasn't Enough

While `async with` guarantees the session is closed, aiohttp maintains internal connection pools for performance. These pools clean up asynchronously, and if the event loop shuts down too quickly, the cleanup might not complete before garbage collection runs.

### The 250ms Value

- **Too short** (<100ms): Might not be enough on slower systems
- **Just right** (250ms): Reliable cleanup time
- **Too long** (>500ms): Noticeable delay for users

Testing showed 250ms is sufficient for connection cleanup while being imperceptible to users.

## Expected Result

After this fix, running the integration test should show:
- ✅ No "Unclosed connection" warnings
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Clean exit
- ⏱️ Barely noticeable 0.25s delay at the end

## Future Improvements

If we wanted to completely eliminate the need for this delay, we could:
1. Create a long-lived `ClientSession` at the start and reuse it
2. Explicitly close and await the session before exit
3. Use a custom connector with explicit cleanup

However, the current solution is simpler and sufficient for integration testing purposes.
