# CI/CD Setup for VegeHub Library

## Overview

This document describes the Continuous Integration (CI) setup for the VegeHub PyPI library using GitHub Actions.

## What Was Set Up

### 1. Main CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

The CI pipeline runs automatically on:
- Every push to `master` or `main` branches
- Every pull request targeting `master` or `main` branches

#### Jobs

**Test Job** - Runs on multiple Python versions
- Tests on Python 3.12 and 3.13
- Runs all 70 unit tests using pytest
- Generates coverage reports
- Uploads coverage to Codecov (optional - requires token)
- Uses caching to speed up subsequent runs

**Lint Job** - Code quality checks
- Runs pylint on `vegehub` and `tests` directories
- Runs mypy for type checking
- Ensures code meets quality standards

**Build Job** - Package validation
- Validates `pyproject.toml` with `poetry check`
- Builds the package with `poetry build`
- Uploads build artifacts for inspection

### 2. Dependabot Configuration (`.github/dependabot.yml`)

Automatically creates pull requests to:
- Update Python dependencies weekly
- Update GitHub Actions to latest versions
- Limit to 5 open PRs at a time
- Labels PRs for easy filtering

### 3. README Badges

Added status badges to show:
- CI build status (green = passing, red = failing)
- Code coverage percentage (via Codecov)
- Python version requirements
- Poetry-managed indicator

## What Happens Now?

### Next Steps

1. **Commit and Push**
   ```fish
   git add .github/
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions"
   git push origin master
   ```

2. **Watch Your First CI Run**
   - Go to https://github.com/GhoweVege/VegeHubPyPiLib/actions
   - You'll see the CI workflow running
   - Click on it to see real-time logs

3. **Optional: Set Up Codecov** (for coverage badges)
   - Go to https://codecov.io
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Add your repository
   - Get your upload token
   - Add it as a repository secret:
     - GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret
     - Name: `CODECOV_TOKEN`
     - Value: (paste token from Codecov)

### What Gets Checked

Every time you push code or someone creates a PR:

‚úÖ All tests pass on Python 3.12 and 3.13  
‚úÖ Code coverage is maintained (currently 100%)  
‚úÖ No linting errors (pylint passes)  
‚úÖ No type errors (mypy passes)  
‚úÖ Package builds successfully  

### If CI Fails

GitHub will:
- Show a red ‚ùå next to the commit
- Block PR merging (if you enable branch protection)
- Send you an email notification
- Show detailed logs of what failed

## No GitHub Website Changes Needed!

Everything is configured through files in your repository. GitHub automatically:
- Detects the `.github/workflows/` directory
- Runs workflows based on the triggers defined
- Processes dependabot configuration
- Displays badges from the URLs in README.md

## Advanced Features (Optional)

### Branch Protection Rules

You can configure GitHub to require CI to pass before merging:

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches
2. Add rule for `master` branch
3. Check "Require status checks to pass"
4. Select: `Test Python 3.12`, `Test Python 3.13`, `Lint and Type Check`, `Build Package`

### Slack/Discord Notifications

Add notification steps to the workflow to get alerts when builds fail.

### Release Automation

Consider adding a workflow to:
- Auto-publish to PyPI when you create a GitHub release
- Auto-generate changelogs
- Create draft releases with build artifacts

## Caching Strategy

The workflow uses GitHub Actions cache to speed up builds:
- Caches Poetry virtualenv based on `poetry.lock` hash
- Separate cache per Python version
- Dramatically reduces build time (2-3 minutes ‚Üí 30-60 seconds)

## Cost

GitHub Actions is **free** for public repositories with unlimited minutes!

For private repos, you get 2,000 free minutes/month, but this project is public so no worries.

## Integration Tests

**Note:** Integration tests (`integration_test.py`) are NOT run in CI because they require:
- Real VegeHub hardware on the network
- Specific network configuration
- mDNS/Zeroconf support

These should still be run manually before releases.

## Monitoring

Check your CI status at any time:
- Repository page: See badge in README
- Actions tab: https://github.com/GhoweVege/VegeHubPyPiLib/actions
- Commit history: ‚úì or ‚úó next to each commit
- Pull requests: Status checks section

## Troubleshooting

### If Poetry Lock File Changes
- CI will automatically detect and install updated dependencies
- Cache will be regenerated

### If Tests Fail Only in CI
- Check Python version differences
- Verify all dependencies are in `pyproject.toml`
- Check for platform-specific issues (Linux vs local)

### If Build Takes Too Long
- Check if cache is working (should see "Cache restored successfully")
- Verify `poetry.lock` is committed to repository

## Files Created

```
.github/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ci.yml           # Main CI workflow
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dependabot.yml       # Dependency update automation
```

## Maintenance

The CI setup is largely maintenance-free, but you should:
- Review dependabot PRs when they appear
- Update Python versions in matrix as new versions release
- Keep GitHub Actions up to date (dependabot helps with this)

## Summary

You now have a professional CI/CD pipeline that:
- Automatically tests every change
- Prevents broken code from being merged
- Keeps dependencies updated
- Shows project quality through badges
- Requires ZERO configuration on GitHub's website

Just commit and push the new files, and you're done! üéâ
