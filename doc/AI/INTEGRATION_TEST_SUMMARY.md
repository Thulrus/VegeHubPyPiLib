# Integration Test Summary

## What Was Added

### 1. Integration Test Script (`integration_test.py`)

A standalone interactive test script that:

- **Discovers VegeHub devices** automatically using mDNS/Zeroconf
- **Interactive device selection** - user chooses which device to test
- **Optional actuator testing** - with safety warnings and user confirmation
- **Comprehensive test coverage** - 8 tests covering all major library features
- **Detailed reporting** - Real-time progress and final summary

### 2. VS Code Task

Added "Run Integration Tests" task to `.vscode/tasks.json`:
- Accessible via Terminal > Run Task
- Runs with proper Poetry environment
- Opens in new terminal panel

### 3. Documentation

- **README.md** - Added "Running Integration Tests" section
- **INTEGRATION_TESTS.md** - Comprehensive guide including:
  - How the tests work
  - Safety features
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - How to add more tests

### 4. Dependencies

- Added `zeroconf` to dev dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
- Updated `poetry.lock` with new dependency

## Test Coverage

The integration tests cover:

1. ✅ Basic properties (ip_address, url)
2. ✅ MAC address retrieval
3. ✅ Device info updates (with all property accessors)
4. ✅ Property accessors (num_sensors, num_actuators, sw_version, is_ac)
5. ✅ Actuator state retrieval
6. ✅ Actuator control (optional, with safe parameters)
7. ✅ Configuration access
8. ✅ Error handling

## Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already installed)
poetry install

# Run integration tests
poetry run python integration_test.py

# Or use VS Code task
Terminal > Run Task > Run Integration Tests
```

### What Happens

1. Script scans network for 5 seconds to find VegeHub devices
2. Displays list of found devices
3. User selects a device to test
4. User decides whether to test actuators (optional)
5. User confirms configuration
6. Tests run with real-time progress display
7. Final summary shows passed/failed/skipped tests

## Safety Features

- **Read-only by default** - Most tests don't modify device state
- **Optional actuator testing** - User must explicitly opt-in
- **Safe actuator parameters** - Uses state=0, duration=0
- **Confirmation prompts** - User reviews before tests run
- **Keyboard interrupt handling** - Can cancel at any time with Ctrl+C

## Design Decisions

### Why Separate from Unit Tests?

- **Hardware required** - Can't run in CI/CD
- **Interactive** - Requires user input
- **Slower** - Real network I/O
- **Different purpose** - Validates real hardware, not code paths

### Why Interactive?

- **Safety** - User controls when/what to test
- **Flexibility** - Choose device and test scope
- **Clarity** - User sees exactly what's being tested

### Why mDNS Discovery?

- **Convenience** - No manual IP entry needed
- **Multi-device support** - Easy to test multiple hubs
- **Network validation** - Confirms mDNS is working

## Future Enhancements

Possible additions (not implemented):

- Config file for default device selection
- Command-line arguments for non-interactive mode
- Detailed timing metrics
- Test against multiple devices simultaneously
- Coverage comparison with unit tests
- Integration with Home Assistant test servers

## Testing the Tests

The integration test script itself has been tested:

- ✅ Syntax validation (py_compile)
- ✅ Import validation (runs without VegeHub present)
- ✅ Device discovery runs (reports "no devices" correctly)
- ✅ VS Code task configured
- ✅ Dependencies installed

To fully test, run with an actual VegeHub device on the network.
