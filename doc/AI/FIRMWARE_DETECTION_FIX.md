# Firmware Detection Logic Fix

## Problem

The firmware detection logic was incorrectly identifying old firmware devices as new firmware. The issue occurred because:

1. Old firmware devices return `endpoints: null` in their config response when requested
2. The detection logic only checked `if "endpoints" in config_data`
3. This returned `True` even when `endpoints` was `None`

Additionally, the logic was requiring the endpoints array to be **non-empty**, which would incorrectly reject new firmware devices that simply haven't configured any endpoints yet.

## Debug Output Example

Old firmware device (192.168.0.102) was incorrectly detected:
```
Debug: Config keys: ['hub', 'api_key', 'endpoints', 'error']
✓ Detected firmware type: new (endpoints array)
```

Even though it has `hub` and `api_key` (old format), the presence of `endpoints` key (with `None` value) caused misdetection.

## Root Cause

When we added `"endpoints": []` to the payload in `_get_device_config()`:
```python
payload: dict[Any, Any] = {"hub": [], "api_key": [], "endpoints": []}
```

Old firmware devices respond with:
```json
{
  "hub": {...},
  "api_key": "...",
  "endpoints": null,
  "error": 0
}
```

New firmware devices respond with:
```json
{
  "endpoints": [...],  // Can be empty array
  "error": 0
}
```

## The Fix

### Updated Detection Logic

Changed from checking if the key exists to checking if it's a **valid list**:

**Before:**
```python
if "endpoints" in config_data:
```

**After:**
```python
if ("endpoints" in config_data and
    isinstance(config_data.get("endpoints"), list)):
```

This properly distinguishes:
- **Old firmware**: `endpoints: null` → `isinstance(None, list)` = `False`
- **New firmware**: `endpoints: []` or `endpoints: [...]` → `isinstance(list, list)` = `True`

### Removed Non-Empty Requirement

The original fix incorrectly required endpoints to be non-empty:
```python
# WRONG - rejects new firmware with no endpoints configured
len(config_data.get("endpoints", [])) > 0
```

The corrected logic allows empty arrays:
```python
# CORRECT - accepts empty endpoints array
isinstance(config_data.get("endpoints"), list)
```

An empty endpoints array is a valid state for new firmware that hasn't been configured yet.

## Files Changed

### 1. `vegehub/vegehub.py`

**Function**: `_modify_device_config()` (line ~218)

```python
# Check if the new endpoints format is present and valid
# endpoints must be a list (can be empty) for new firmware
# If endpoints is None or not present, it's old firmware
if ("endpoints" in config_data and
    isinstance(config_data.get("endpoints"), list)):
```

### 2. `integration_test.py`

Updated in **three places**:

**A. Initial firmware detection** (line ~482):
```python
if ("endpoints" in original_config and
    isinstance(original_config.get("endpoints"), list)):
```

**B. Modified config verification** (line ~517):
```python
if ("endpoints" in modified_config and
    isinstance(modified_config.get("endpoints"), list)):
```

**C. Restoration verification** (line ~556):
```python
if ("endpoints" in original_config and
    isinstance(original_config.get("endpoints"), list)):
```

## Test Results

### Old Firmware (192.168.0.102)
**Expected behavior**: Detect as old firmware
```
Debug: Config keys: ['hub', 'api_key', 'endpoints', 'error']
Debug: endpoints value: None
✓ Detected firmware type: old (api_key/hub structure)
```

### New Firmware (with endpoints)
**Expected behavior**: Detect as new firmware
```
Debug: Config keys: ['endpoints', 'error']
Debug: endpoints value: [...]
✓ Detected firmware type: new (endpoints array)
```

### New Firmware (no endpoints configured)
**Expected behavior**: Detect as new firmware (empty array is valid)
```
Debug: Config keys: ['endpoints', 'error']
Debug: endpoints value: []
✓ Detected firmware type: new (endpoints array)
```

## Validation

✅ Unit tests pass (70 passed)
✅ Backward compatible with old firmware
✅ Correctly handles new firmware with empty endpoints
✅ Correctly handles new firmware with configured endpoints
✅ Prevents `TypeError` from trying to call `len()` on `None`

## Key Insights

1. **Check type, not just presence**: When dealing with API responses that might return `null` values, always validate the type, not just key presence
2. **Empty is valid**: An empty array/list is often a valid state (e.g., no endpoints configured yet)
3. **Debug output is essential**: The debug output showing `endpoints: None` vs `endpoints: []` made the issue immediately clear
