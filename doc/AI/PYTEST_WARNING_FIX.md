# Pytest Collection Warning Fix

## Problem

When running pytest, there was a warning:
```
integration_test.py:203: PytestCollectionWarning: cannot collect test class 'TestResults'
because it has a __init__ constructor
```

## Root Cause

Pytest automatically tries to collect any class that starts with "Test" as a test class. The `TestResults` class in `integration_test.py` was being mistakenly identified as a test class, causing the warning.

## The Fix

Renamed the class from `TestResults` to `IntegrationTestResults` to avoid the pytest naming convention conflict.

### Changes Made

**File**: `integration_test.py`

1. **Class definition** (line 203):
   ```python
   # Before
   class TestResults:
       """Track test results."""

   # After
   class IntegrationTestResults:
       """Track integration test results."""
   ```

2. **Function return type** (line 262):
   ```python
   # Before
   async def run_integration_tests(...) -> TestResults:

   # After
   async def run_integration_tests(...) -> IntegrationTestResults:
   ```

3. **Object instantiation** (line 275):
   ```python
   # Before
   results = TestResults()

   # After
   results = IntegrationTestResults()
   ```

4. **Docstring** (line 273):
   ```python
   # Before
   Returns:
       TestResults object

   # After
   Returns:
       IntegrationTestResults object
   ```

## Result

✅ Pytest no longer shows the collection warning
✅ All 70 tests still pass
✅ No functional changes - just a naming improvement

## Pytest Naming Conventions

Pytest automatically collects:
- Files matching `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`
- Classes starting with `Test` (without an `__init__` method)
- Functions starting with `test_`

To avoid conflicts with classes that are not test classes but start with "Test", use more specific names like:
- `IntegrationTestResults`
- `ResultTracker`
- `TestResultCollector`
- Or any name that doesn't start with `Test`
