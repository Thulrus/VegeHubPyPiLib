# Verbose Integration Test Updates

## Overview
Enhanced the integration test script to provide more user control and verbose feedback, particularly for Test 7 (Setup Function testing).

## Changes Made

### 1. New User Prompts
Added two interactive prompts before running tests:

1. **Setup Function Testing** - Asks if user wants to test the setup function
   - Displays warning that this will temporarily modify device config
   - Default: Yes
   - If declined, Test 7 is skipped

2. **Config Restoration** - Asks if user wants to restore original config after setup test
   - Only appears if user chose to test setup function
   - Default: Yes
   - Warning displayed if user declines (test config will remain on device)

### 2. Updated Function Signature
```python
async def run_integration_tests(ip_address: str,
                                test_actuators: bool,
                                test_setup: bool,
                                restore_config: bool) -> TestResults:
```

Added two new parameters:
- `test_setup`: Whether to run Test 7 (setup function test)
- `restore_config`: Whether to restore original config after Test 7

### 3. Enhanced Test 7 Verbosity

#### Firmware Type Detection
Now displays detected firmware type immediately after reading original config:
```
✓ Detected firmware type: old (api_key/hub structure)
```
or
```
✓ Detected firmware type: new (endpoints array)
```

#### Step-by-Step Progress
Enhanced console output for each step:
- Step 1: Reading original config (with firmware type detection)
- Step 2: Running setup with test values
- Step 3: Verifying config was modified (with firmware-specific confirmation)
- Step 4: Restoring original config (conditional)
- Step 5: Verifying restoration (conditional)

#### Conditional Restoration
Test 7 now respects the `restore_config` parameter:
- If `True`: Performs restoration and verification as before
- If `False`: Skips restoration and displays warning:
  ```
  ⚠ Skipping restoration - test config remains on device!
  ```

#### Improved Error Messages
- Exception handling now includes firmware type in messages
- Restoration attempts only occur if `restore_config=True`
- Better distinction between config verification failures and other errors

### 4. Test Configuration Display
Updated the pre-test configuration summary to show all user choices:
```
Test Configuration:
  Device IP: 192.168.0.102
  Test actuators: Yes
  Test setup function: Yes
  Restore config after setup test: Yes
```

## Usage Examples

### Standard Run (All Tests, With Restoration)
```bash
poetry run python integration_test.py
```
When prompted:
- Test setup function: y
- Restore config: y

### Skip Setup Testing
```bash
poetry run python integration_test.py
```
When prompted:
- Test setup function: n

Result: Test 7 will be skipped with message:
```
Test 7: Setup Function (Config Modification with Backup/Restore)
Status: ⊘ Skipped - User chose not to test setup function
```

### Test Setup But Keep Test Config
```bash
poetry run python integration_test.py
```
When prompted:
- Test setup function: y
- Restore config: n

Result: Test 7 runs but doesn't restore original config. User sees warning:
```
⚠ Skipping restoration - test config remains on device!
```

## Benefits

1. **User Control**: Users can now skip setup testing if they don't want config modifications
2. **Safety Option**: Users can choose to restore or keep test configs
3. **Transparency**: Firmware type is detected and displayed, making test behavior clear
4. **Better Feedback**: Step-by-step progress with checkmarks and warnings
5. **Informed Decisions**: Warnings displayed before any potentially destructive operations

## Technical Notes

### Firmware Type Detection
The test detects firmware type by examining the config structure:
- **New firmware**: Contains `endpoints` array
- **Old firmware**: Contains `api_key` and `hub` keys
- **Unknown**: Neither pattern matched (warning displayed)

### Error Handling
- Exceptions during setup testing still attempt restoration if `restore_config=True`
- Test results include firmware type information for debugging
- Failed verifications don't prevent restoration attempts

### Test Results
Test 7 can now have multiple result messages:
- ✓ "Config modified and restored (old/new firmware)"
- ✓ "Config modified successfully (old/new firmware, not restored)"
- ✗ "Config changes not verified (old/new firmware)"
- ✗ Various error messages with firmware type included
- ⊘ "User chose not to test setup function"
