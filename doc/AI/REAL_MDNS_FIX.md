# The REAL mDNS Discovery Fix

## What We Found

After carefully comparing the **working** diagnostic script with the **non-working** integration test, the issue wasn't the timeout at all—it was a single function call!

## The Smoking Gun

### Diagnostic Script (WORKS):
```python
try:
    browser = ServiceBrowser(zeroconf, service_type, listener)
    # ... wait for discovery ...
finally:
    zeroconf.close()  # ← Just closes zeroconf
```

### Integration Test (DIDN'T WORK):
```python
try:
    browser = ServiceBrowser(zeroconf, "_vege._tcp.local.", listener)
    # ... wait for discovery ...
finally:
    browser.cancel()  # ← THIS WAS THE PROBLEM!
    zeroconf.close()
```

## The Problem: `browser.cancel()`

Calling `browser.cancel()` before `zeroconf.close()` causes the ServiceBrowser to:
1. Stop processing incoming mDNS responses
2. Cancel any pending callbacks
3. Potentially discard devices that were discovered but not yet delivered to the listener

The zeroconf library is designed to handle cleanup automatically when you close the Zeroconf instance. Manually canceling the browser interrupts this process and can prevent callbacks from being delivered.

## The Fix

**Simply remove the `browser.cancel()` call:**

```python
def discover_vegehubs(timeout: int = 10) -> list[dict]:
    zeroconf = Zeroconf()
    listener = VegeHubListener()

    # Keep browser reference to prevent garbage collection
    browser = ServiceBrowser(zeroconf, "_vege._tcp.local.", listener)  # noqa: F841

    try:
        import time
        for i in range(timeout):
            time.sleep(1)
            if i % 2 == 0:
                count = len(listener.devices)
                if count > 0:
                    print(f"  ... found {count} device(s) so far")
    finally:
        # Just close zeroconf - it will properly shut down the browser
        zeroconf.close()

    return listener.devices
```

## Why This Matters

- **Immediate discovery**: Devices found in <1 second (like diagnostic)
- **No race conditions**: Callbacks are properly delivered
- **Proper cleanup**: Zeroconf handles all shutdown logic

## Other Changes Made

Also cleaned up the progress display to match the diagnostic:
- Show progress every 2 seconds (not just when devices found)
- Removed the 0.5 second initial delay (not needed)
- Simplified the loop condition

## Test It Now

The integration test should now discover VegeHub devices immediately:

```bash
poetry run python integration_test.py
```

Expected output:
```
🔍 Searching for VegeHub devices for 10 seconds...
  Discovered: Desk_Temp_Soil._vege._tcp.local.
    → Added: 192.168.0.102
  ... found 1 device(s) so far

✅ Found 1 VegeHub device(s):
  [1] Desk_Temp_Soil._vege._tcp.local. - 192.168.0.102
```

Discovery should happen within the first 2 seconds! 🎉

## Lessons Learned

1. **Trust the library's cleanup**: Don't manually cancel unless you have a specific reason
2. **Compare working vs non-working carefully**: The issue was a single line of code
3. **Timeout wasn't the issue**: The diagnostic proves discovery happens in <1 second
4. **Keep references alive**: The browser variable must not be garbage collected during scanning

## Why We Missed It Earlier

The `browser.cancel()` seemed like good practice for cleanup, and many examples show it. However:
- It's meant for long-running browsers that need early termination
- For short scans that complete naturally, it's not needed
- It can actually interfere with callback delivery
- The Zeroconf destructor handles cleanup properly

The diagnostic script never had this call, which is why it worked from the start!
