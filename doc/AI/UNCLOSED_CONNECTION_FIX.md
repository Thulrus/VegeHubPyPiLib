# Unclosed Connection Warnings Fix

## Problem

When running integration tests, especially Test 7 (Setup Function), multiple "Unclosed connection" warnings appeared:

```
Unclosed connection
client_connection: Connection<ConnectionKey(host='192.168.0.104', port=80, ...
```

These warnings appeared 7 times during Test 7, which makes 3-4 HTTP requests (get config, set config, get config again, verify).

## Root Cause

The library was using manual session creation and cleanup:

```python
session = aiohttp.ClientSession()
try:
    response = await session.post(url, json=payload)
    # ... do work ...
finally:
    await session.close()
```

While this **does** close the session, aiohttp's recommended practice is to use `async with` context managers, which guarantee proper cleanup even if there are exceptions and handle internal connection pooling better.

The warnings occur because:
1. Manual `session.close()` might not wait for all pending operations
2. The event loop might clean up before all connections are fully closed
3. Connection pooling isn't properly managed without context managers

## The Fix

Updated all 7 HTTP client usages to use `async with`:

```python
# BEFORE (manual cleanup)
session = aiohttp.ClientSession()
try:
    response = await session.post(url, json=payload)
    # ... do work ...
finally:
    await session.close()

# AFTER (context manager)
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
    try:
        response = await session.post(url, json=payload)
        # ... do work ...
```

## Functions Updated

All HTTP client functions in `vegehub/vegehub.py`:

1. `_get_device_info()` - Get device information
2. `_get_device_config()` - **Get device config (Test 7)**
3. `_set_device_config()` - **Set device config (Test 7)**
4. `_request_update()` - Request device update
5. `_get_device_mac()` - Get device MAC address
6. `_set_actuator()` - **Set actuator state (Test 6)**
7. `_get_actuator_info()` - **Get actuator states (Tests 5 & 6)**

## Benefits of async with

### 1. Guaranteed Cleanup
Context managers ensure the session is properly closed even if exceptions occur, including:
- Connection errors
- Timeouts
- Unexpected errors

### 2. Proper Connection Pooling
aiohttp manages connection pooling more effectively when using context managers.

### 3. No Warning Messages
The `async with` pattern is the aiohttp-recommended way and eliminates the "Unclosed connection" warnings.

### 4. Cleaner Code
Removes the need for `finally` blocks in most cases (though we keep `try/except` for error handling).

## Code Pattern

The general pattern now used throughout:

```python
async def _some_http_function(self) -> SomeType:
    """Do something over HTTP."""
    url = f"http://{self._ip_address}/api/endpoint"
    
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        try:
            response = await session.post(url, json=payload)
            if response.status != 200:
                raise ConnectionError
            return await response.json()
        except (aiohttp.ClientConnectorError, Exception) as err:
            _LOGGER.error("Error: %s", err)
            raise ConnectionError from err
    # Session automatically closed here
```

## Testing

✅ All 70 unit tests pass
✅ No changes to function behavior
✅ Still properly handles errors and retries
✅ Integration tests should now run without warnings

## Expected Result

When running the integration test again, you should see:
- ✅ No "Unclosed connection" warnings
- ✅ All tests still pass
- ✅ Same functionality, cleaner execution

## Technical Note

This is a best practice change that improves resource management. The previous code **was** closing connections, but not in the aiohttp-preferred way. The warnings were cosmetic but indicated potential resource leaks in edge cases.
